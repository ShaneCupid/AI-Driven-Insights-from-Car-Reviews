# AI-Driven Insights from Car Reviews

## Overview
This project showcases the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract valuable insights from car reviews, enhancing customer service and operational efficiency for an auto dealership. Utilizing a dataset of textual car reviews, the project employs several pre-trained models from Hugging Face for tasks such as sentiment analysis, question answering, text summarization, and translation. This prototype demonstrates how AI and NLP technologies can be seamlessly integrated into the auto industry to improve customer interaction and support services.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3**: For general programming.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Transformers**: For accessing pre-trained NLP models.
- **Torch**: For deep learning models and inference.
- **Evaluate**: For calculating metrics like accuracy and F1 score.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive code execution and result presentation.

## Key Concepts and Models
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classifying the sentiment of car reviews to gauge customer satisfaction.
- **Question Answering**: Automatically answering customer queries based on the content of reviews.
- **Text Summarization**: Condensing long reviews into concise summaries for quick insights.
- **Language Translation**: Translating reviews between languages to support multilingual customers.
- **Model Evaluation**: Using accuracy and F1 score to assess the performance of sentiment analysis.

## How It Works
1. Car reviews and sentiment labels are loaded and preprocessed.
2. Sentiment analysis is performed on the reviews using a pre-trained LLM.
3. A question answering model is employed to respond to specific queries.
4. Reviews are summarized and translated using dedicated NLP pipelines.
5. The sentiment analysis model's performance is evaluated using accuracy and F1 metrics.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Python 3 with necessary libraries (Pandas, Transformers, Torch, Evaluate) installed.
* Access to Jupyter Notebook or similar environment to run the analysis.
* The dataset, stored in CSV format, ready for analysis.
